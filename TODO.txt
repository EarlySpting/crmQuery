Crmquery can be simplified by assuming that criteria will be added in order.

Currently we rely on the entity name being passed in as the first argument to 
Where(), if we assume that we are always operating on the last given link
we never have to pass anything. This simplifies things both in impementation
and in usage.

Note that we have been adding criteria in a slightly incorrect way, which worked
for logical 'And' but won't work for 'Or'.

- refactoring:

add CreateConditionExpression() method to abstract creating condition expressions
in Or() and WhereExpression(). This will remove one set of #if directives and
clean up conditional compilation. 

add SetValues() to abstract differences in the Values property between crm4 and 5.
this may not be so bad once we have something like CreateConditionExpression()
so maybe it is a lower priority.

decision tree of finding the last added link is repeated in Join() and Where().

do we need to return different levels of the query expression rather than be 
stateful? Stateful operation requires us to do things in order, and makes it 
difficult to do something like add 2 joins on the same entity. We pass the 
entity name each time to enable this, which is cumbersome in the syntax. Might
be better to have methods that signal the end of an expression.
