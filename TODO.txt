Crmquery can be simplified by assuming that criteria will be added in order.

Currently we rely on the entity name being passed in as the first argument to 
Where(), if we assume that we are always operating on the last given link
we never have to pass anything. This simplifies things both in impementation
and in usage.

Note that we have been adding criteria in a slightly incorrect way, which worked
for logical 'And' but won't work for 'Or'.
